--------------
*contextaudio.js* is a wrapper round JavaScript's Web Audio API which provides a simple system for controlling audio on the Web. This wrapper class makes it easy to work with the AudioContext interface and AudioBuffer.
The primary goal is to make this class *stream an audio source*, *play*, *pause*, *stop*, *seek* and *control volume*.
